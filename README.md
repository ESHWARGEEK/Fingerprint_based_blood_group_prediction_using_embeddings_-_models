# 🧬 Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection using Deep Learning & Embeddings  
<img src="/results/Screenshot 2025-08-30 090907.png">
In this project we are combining prediction from ensemble and embedding prediction as we are lacking availability real world data of fingerprints as it is subject to security of information we added embedding prediction to balance prediction from ensemble models

<img src="/results/Screenshot 2025-08-30 091102.png">
we can see if model prediction confidence is less than 70% we go for embedding prediction 


This project demonstrates the use of **fingerprint biometrics** and **deep learning** to predict a person’s blood group. The system combines **CNN-based classification models** with **fingerprint embeddings** stored in a **vector database** for efficient retrieval and similarity search.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Multi-class Classification**: Detects **8 blood groups** (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-).  
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented **ResNet50, VGG16, ConvNeXt**, and an **ensemble** for improved accuracy.  
- **Dataset Expansion**: Increased dataset size from **8K → 50K+ images** using augmentation.  
- **Embeddings Integration**: Extracted fingerprint embeddings and stored in **Oracle Vector DB (IVFFlat, cosine similarity)**.  
- **Deployment**: Real-time predictions via **Flask/Streamlit web app** with fingerprint upload.  
- **Performance**: Achieved **60%+ test accuracy** across 8 blood group classes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV  
- **Database**: Oracle Database with Vector Search  
- **Deployment**: Flask, Streamlit  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

##📊Results
- **Achieved** > **75% accuracy** on 8-class fingerprint blood group classification.
- Embeddings stored in **Oracle DB** to enable **fast similarity search**
- Results are available at the docs/

##🔮Future Work
- Improve accuracy using Vision Transformers (ViTs) and attention-based models.
- Collect larger, more diverse fingerprint datasets.
- Extend to multimodal biometric + health record integration.

Future implementations:
- planning to integrate with Large Language models(LLM's) to give structure output along with facts of particular blood group 
and tell it's users that how this models can give prediction by showing pattern in the fingerprint
